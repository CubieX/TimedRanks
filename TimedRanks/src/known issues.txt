Known issues:
-------------

- only german translation active until now
- on first load, plugin will fail to load because config file version of plromotedPlayers.yml is not correctly recognized.
  Workaround: Start the server a second time, so the config files will already be present in your plugin data folder, or
              copy the config files provided in the download in your plugin data folder before starting the server.
- help messages may be out of order, because async chat handling messes it up.
